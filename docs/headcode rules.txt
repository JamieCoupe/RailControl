Rule 1 — Class digit

The FIRST digit encodes train type:

Class	Meaning
1	Express passenger (includes intercity, EMU fast)
2	Stopping / local passenger
3	Parcels / Royal Mail
4	Fast freight (> 75mph)
5	ECS (Empty Coaching Stock)
6	Freight (≤ 60mph)
7	Freight (≤ 45mph)
8	Heavy freight (≤ 35mph)
9	Special high-speed / HST / new IETs

Your passenger timetable already knows whether a service is "express" or "stopping" → so class chooses itself.

Rule 2 — Route / Region Letter

Second character is a capital letter representing the route geography:

Code	Meaning
A	Anglia / Eastern
C	Central / LNW Midlands
E	Tyneside / Northeast
F	Southern Region coastal branches
H	Highland (Scotland)
M	Manchester / NW
N	North / ECML
S	Scotland
T	Trans-Pennine
V	Western Region mainlines
W	Wales
Z	Special workings

For Scotland we typically use:

S for Scottish region

H for Highland (Fort William, Inverness)

Rule 3 — Train Number (two digits)

Range 00–99

For a full system we will generate:

sequential numbers

uniqueness per day

reuse per hour or per route

But for now we allow:

service_number = 01 → 99

Rule 4 — Destination Letter (rarely used today)

Old BR practice used the last letter to encode the final destination or major junction.

Modern headcodes do NOT include the destination letter (the 4th character is numeric).

So your format is always:

1S12   # OK
4M40   # OK
2H71   # OK


We are not doing 1960s “A to Z termination” style.
